    <!-- Chosen Palette: Calm Harmony Neutrals -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is designed as a narrative journey to guide a beginner from a simple analogy to a more complete understanding. It starts with a high-level "supermarket" analogy (Hero), explains the core purpose (Why it Exists), introduces the participants (The Players), visualizes the main process (How a Trade Works), provides concrete US examples (The Big Two), and concludes with the overall economic importance (Why It Matters). This thematic, step-by-step structure was chosen over a dry, report-like format to make the complex topic digestible, engaging, and less intimidating for someone with no financial background. The user flow is intentionally linear but allows for focused interaction within each self-contained section. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        1. Core Purpose -> Goal: Organize/Inform -> Viz: HTML/CSS Diagram -> Interaction: Static visual flow -> Justification: A simple, non-interactive diagram is the clearest way to show the foundational relationship between companies, capital, and investors without overwhelming the user. Method: Tailwind CSS.
        2. The Players -> Goal: Organize/Inform -> Viz: Tabbed Content Panels -> Interaction: User clicks on a player's role to reveal their description -> Justification: A tabbed interface is a space-efficient and intuitive way to introduce multiple distinct roles. It encourages user interaction and allows them to learn at their own pace. Method: Vanilla JS.
        3. How a Trade Works -> Goal: Change/Process -> Viz: Interactive Step-by-Step Timeline -> Interaction: User clicks "Next/Previous" to move through the stages of a trade, with a progress bar updating visually -> Justification: A sequential process is best explained through a guided, step-by-step format. This makes the abstract concept of a trade feel concrete and easy to follow. Method: Vanilla JS.
        4. NYSE vs. NASDAQ Comparison -> Goal: Compare -> Viz: Bar Chart -> Interaction: Hovering over bars reveals tooltips with specific market cap data -> Justification: A bar chart provides an immediate, powerful visual comparison of the two major exchanges' scale. Method: Chart.js (Canvas).

                    Imagine a giant, well-organized supermarket. Instead of selling apples and bread, a stock exchange is a marketplace that sells tiny pieces of ownership in large companies. These pieces are called "stocks" or "shares." This special marketplace provides a safe and regulated environment where people can easily buy these shares from and sell them to others. It's the central hub that connects companies needing money to grow with people who want to invest their money.

                    This section illustrates the fundamental purpose of a stock exchange. It's a system designed to benefit both companies and the public. Companies get access to the funds they need to innovate and expand, while investors get the opportunity to share in the potential success of those companies. This visual shows the circular flow of value that powers economic growth.

                    Stock exchanges are more than just places to trade stocks; they are a vital part of the modern economy. They allow companies to access the capital they need to grow and create jobs. For individuals, they provide a transparent and accessible way to invest in the country's economic growth, helping people save for retirement, education, and other long-term goals. By providing liquidity and a clear measure of a company's value, stock exchanges help fuel the engine of innovation and progress.
